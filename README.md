## EV Preference Prediction for Sustainable Infrastructure
This project predicts global electric vehicle preferences (BEV vs PHEV) using Random Forest. The results help optimize charging station locations and support eco-friendly transport policies.

### Tools Used
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Kaggle dataset (linked)
- CRISP-DM methodology
